## My process
1.Gather Information: I start by collecting everything I need to build the website. This might include things like:

2.Find Inspiration: Then, I look at reference images in a folder provided to get ideas for the website's design. This helps me visualize the layout and style.

3.Building Blocks: I start putting the website together using HTML and CSS. HTML provides the structure and content, while CSS styles the website's appearance.

4.Desktop First: I focus on building the website for desktop screens first, making sure it looks good and functions properly.

5.Going Responsive: Once the desktop version is complete, I make the website responsive. This means adjusting the layout and styling so it looks good and functions well on different devices, like tablets and smartphones.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of my personal workflow for web development. Here's what I learned:

Importance of Gathering Information: I found that taking the time to clearly understand the project's goals and target audience upfront is crucial. This initial planning phase helps guide the website's design and functionality throughout the build process.

Leveraging Reference Materials: Using reference images as inspiration proved to be a valuable tool. It allowed me to visualize the website's look and feel before diving into code.
Building in Stages: Focusing on the desktop version first and then making it responsive was an efficient approach. It allowed me to solidify the core structure and styling before tackling the complexities of responsive design.

Overall, this project was a great opportunity to experiment and discover what works best for me when building websites.  By reflecting on my workflow, I can continue to refine my process and become a more efficient developer.
